//What is a function? (from MDN)
//Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JS
//A function is a JavaScript procedure, which is:
//A set of statements that perform a task or calculate a value
//A function definition (or declaration) consists of a function keyword, followed by:
    //-The name of the function
    //-A list of parameters to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas
    //-The JS statements that define the function, enclosed in curly braces { }

// definition:
function nameOfFunction(/*list of parameters*/) {
  /*statements that define the function*/
}

//calling the function (test):
var result = nameOfFunction(/*list of arguments*/);
console.log(result);

//Other ways to write functions:
//There are several other ways to write functions
//For now, we will not concern ourselves with them

//Less Explicit Challenges:
//Up to this point, the challenges spell out nearly everything you need to do
//Challenges past this point will be less explicit
//You should use context clues, and develop a strategy for each challenge
