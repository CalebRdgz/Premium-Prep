//What is Undefined?
//Consider the following code.

var declaration;
console.log(declaration);
//Please run the code listed above in a console.

/*
As you can see, we have logged undefined to the console
When we say var declaration;, we have declared a variable called declaration
But, we have yet to assign it a particular value
JavaScript handles this by storing the name of the variable in memory, and giving it a default value of undefined
