What are Conditionals?
So far you have learned about several data types
We have also learned about variables to store said data types
Furthermore, we have explored a large number of operators and methods
Now, let's examine the idea of our program's doing, or not doing, something based upon a condition
It is useful to begin with plain english language statements:
If it is raining, you should wear a raincoat.
If Creed will be there, then I will go, otherwise I will stay home.
If Denny's is open, we will dine there, otherwise, if IHop is open,
we will dine there, and finally, if neither diner is open,
we will make pancakes at home.
Relatively simple ideas
Let us look at a "pseudocode" implementations of these statements after introducing pseudocode more formally

What is Pseudocode?
We have seen it before
English language statements that describe what the code will do
Should be structured similarly to the way the eventual code will be (indentation, etc.)
Each line of pseudocode should correspond to one line of actual code
// if it is raining
  // you should wear a raincoat
// if creed is there
  // I will go
// otherwise
  // I will stay home
// if Denny's is open
  // we will dine at denny's
// otherwise if IHop is open
  // we will dine at IHop
// otherwise
  // we will make pancakes at home
