//Write a function coinFlip that returns at random either 'heads' or 'tails'
//HINT: look into Math.random() on MDN

coinFlip() //'heads'
//or
coinFlip() //'tails'

var heads = 0;
var tails = 0;

//BONUS: Can tou devise a way to investigate if your function produces 'heads' and 'tails' with a roughly 50/50 split?
